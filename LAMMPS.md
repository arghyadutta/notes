# Titbits of LAMMPS
Nothing original here, everything compiled from other sources. But it is hard to find
useful instruction about LAMMPS in one place on the web. I am trying to put together 
few useful commands and ideas which I got online in one place for *my* easy comprehension.

#### Parts of an input script: [Source](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~stefanb/Files/HPCTutorials/MD-lammps-Final.pdf)
* Parts of An Input Script
  * Initialize: units, dimensions, etc.
  * Atomic positions and velocities
  * Settings:
    * Interatomic potential
    * Run time simulation parameters (e.g. timestep)
    * Fixes - operations during dynamics (e.g. thermostat)
    * Computes - calculation of properties during dynamics
  * Run!

#### Generating the initial configuration

This can be done by hand or using dedicated packages.

Description

Create bonds between pairs of atoms as a simulation runs according to specified criteria. This can be used to model cross-linking of polymers, the formation of a percolation network, etc. In this context, a bond means an interaction between a pair of atoms computed by the bond_style command. Once the bond is created it will be permanently in place. Optionally, the creation of a bond can also create angle, dihedral, and improper interactions that bond is part of. See the discussion of the atype, dtype, and itype keywords below.
#### The underlying principle

#### Setting up the force field 

#### LAMMPS units 

#### Running the simulation  
* [`fix nve/limit`](http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_nve_limit.html)  
fix ID group-ID nve/limit xmax  
xmax = maximum distance an atom can move in one timestep (distance units)  
Example: fix 1 all nve/limit 0.1  
Perform constant NVE updates of position and velocity for atoms in the group each timestep. NVE means update is done in microcanonical ensemble. A limit is imposed on the maximum distance an atom can move in one timestep. This is useful when starting a simulation with a configuration containing highly overlapped atoms. Normally this would generate huge forces which would blow atoms out of the simulation box, causing LAMMPS to stop with an error.

* [`fix langevin`](http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_langevin.html)
fix ID group-ID langevin Tstart Tstop damp seed keyword values ...  
ID, group-ID are documented in fix command  
langevin = style name of this fix command  
Tstart,Tstop = desired temperature at start/end of run (temperature units)  
Tstart can be a variable (see below)  
damp = damping parameter (time units)  
seed = random number seed to use for white noise (positive integer)  
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended  
keyword = angmom or omega or scale or tally or zero 
Example: fix 3 boundary langevin 1.0 1.0 1000.0 699483  
Apply a Langevin thermostat as described in (Schneider) to a group of atoms which models an interaction with a background implicit solvent. Used with fix nve, this command performs Brownian dynamics (BD), since the total force on each atom will have the form:

F = Fc + Ff + Fr
Ff = - (m / damp) v
Fr is proportional to sqrt(Kb T m / (dt damp))
Fc is the conservative force computed via the usual inter-particle interactions (pair_style, bond_style, etc).

The Ff and Fr terms are added by this fix on a per-particle basis. See the pair_style dpd/tstat command for a thermostatting option that adds similar terms on a pairwise basis to pairs of interacting particles.

Ff is a frictional drag or viscous damping term proportional to the particleâ€™s velocity. The proportionality constant for each atom is computed as m/damp, where m is the mass of the particle and damp is the damping factor specified by the user.

Fr is a force due to solvent atoms at a temperature T randomly bumping into the particle. As derived from the fluctuation/dissipation theorem, its magnitude as shown above is proportional to sqrt(Kb T m / dt damp), where Kb is the Boltzmann constant, T is the desired temperature, m is the mass of the particle, dt is the timestep size, and damp is the damping factor. Random numbers are used to randomize the direction and magnitude of this force as described in (Dunweg), where a uniform random number is used (instead of a Gaussian random number) for speed.

Note that unless you use the omega or angmom keywords, the thermostat effect of this fix is applied to only the translational degrees of freedom for the particles, which is an important consideration for finite-size particles, which have rotational degrees of freedom, are being thermostatted. The translational degrees of freedom can also have a bias velocity removed from them before thermostatting takes place; see the description below.
