# Titbits of LAMMPS
Nothing original here, everything compiled from other sources. But it is hard to find
useful instruction about LAMMPS in one place on the web. I am trying to put together 
few useful commands and ideas which I got online in one place for *my* easy comprehension.

#### Generating the initial configuration

This can be done by hand or using dedicated packages.

#### The underlying principle

#### Setting up the force field 

#### LAMMPS units 

#### Running the simulation  

#### Output particle position 

#### Output thermodynamic variables 

#### Helpful web-pages 
1. Official LAMMPS Documentation: http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Manual.html (most unhelpful for beginners, IMHO. :-1:)
