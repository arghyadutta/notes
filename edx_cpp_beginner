edX cpp coourse notes

Compilation= preprocessor+compiler+linker

use wchar_t to represent international characters

use short (2 bytes) instead of int (4 bytes) if your data range allows (-32k to 32k)

use double instead of float for better precision.

use const everywhere possible. specially if in your mind you think that you will not 
change some variable and later mistakenly try to change that. compiler throws an error
saying that you changed your mind, feeble hooman?

int main()
{
  const int a=2;
  a=3; // error
}

from their page:

When you want to explicitly perform a conversion or cast, you can use the type cast features of C++. For example, the previous widening conversion in the int to long cast was implicit but you can also tell the compiler that you are know what you are doing by using the type cast statement as in:

long myLong = (long)myInt;

// or you can use this version as well

long myLong = long(myInt);

C++ also provides a cast operator that is more restrictive in its usage. This in the form static_cast (type). This static cast operator can be used for converting numeric values or to numeric values. As an example:

char ch;
int i = 65;
float f = 2.5;
double dbl;
ch = static_cast<char>(i);   // int to char
dbl = static_cast<double>(f);   // float to double
