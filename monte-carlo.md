## Monte Carlo without equations
* Aim : explain monte carlo using sentences, no equations.

## Motivation
Monte Carlo is a place in Italy famous for its casinos.
Monte Carlo in simulation lingo assumes that random kicks act on particles in a box to simulate velocities.
Computationally these random numbers can be added to the postions using random number generators, which take a random seed as input.

##### some side tracking
There are some cracked games that require us to move our cursor around a specified zone in the installation GUI, which the software uses
as random seed for some purpose. Read more about that [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/10443).

## Definitions
Here we consider that we are in NVT. Read about [NVT](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.quimica.urv.es/~bo/MOLMOD/General/Dynamics/Ensembles.html&num=1&strip=1&vwsrc=0).
